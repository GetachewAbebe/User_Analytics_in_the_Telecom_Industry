## Overview
This project aims to analyze user behavior and engagement in a telecommunications dataset. It is divided into three main tasks: User Overview Analysis, User Engagement Analysis, and Creating a README file.

## Task 2 - User Overview Analysis
The User Overview Analysis task involves understanding user behavior and exploring insights from the dataset. It includes sub-tasks such as identifying the top handsets used by customers, conducting exploratory data analysis, and deriving useful insights from the data.

### Sub-Tasks
1. **Identify the top 10 handsets used by customers.**
2. **Identify the top 3 handset manufacturers.**
3. **Identify the top 5 handsets per top 3 handset manufacturers.**
4. **Make interpretations and recommendations to the marketing teams based on the analysis.**

## Task 3 - User Engagement Analysis
The User Engagement Analysis task focuses on tracking user engagement using various metrics. It involves aggregating metrics per customer, normalizing engagement metrics, and using k-means clustering to classify customers based on their engagement.

### Sub-Tasks
1. **Aggregate metrics per customer and report the top 10 customers per engagement metric.**
2. **Normalize each engagement metric and classify customers using k-means (k=3).**
3. **Compute statistics for each cluster and interpret the results visually.**
4. **Aggregate user total traffic per application and derive the top 10 most engaged users per application.**
5. **Plot the top 3 most used applications using appropriate charts.**
6. **Determine the optimized value of k using the elbow method for k-means clustering.**
