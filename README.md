Telecom User Analytics Project
Overview
This project aims to analyze user behavior and engagement in a telecommunications dataset. The project is divided into three main tasks: User Overview Analysis, User Engagement Analysis, and Creating a README file.

Task 2 - User Overview Analysis
The User Overview Analysis task involves understanding user behavior and exploring insights from the dataset. It includes sub-tasks such as identifying the top handsets used by customers, conducting exploratory data analysis, and deriving useful insights from the data.

Sub-Tasks
Identify the top 10 handsets used by customers.
Identify the top 3 handset manufacturers.
Identify the top 5 handsets per top 3 handset manufacturers.
Make interpretations and recommendations to the marketing teams based on the analysis.
Task 3 - User Engagement Analysis
The User Engagement Analysis task focuses on tracking user engagement using various engagement metrics. It involves aggregating metrics per customer, normalizing engagement metrics, and using k-means clustering to classify customers based on their engagement.

Sub-Tasks
Aggregate metrics per customer and report the top 10 customers per engagement metric.
Normalize each engagement metric and classify customers using k-means (k=3).
Compute statistics for each cluster and interpret the results visually.
Aggregate user total traffic per application and derive the top 10 most engaged users per application.
Plot the top 3 most used applications using appropriate charts.
Determine the optimized value of k using the elbow method for k-means clustering.
